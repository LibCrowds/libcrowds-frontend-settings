Playbills is part of the LibCrowds platform, which aims to increase access to 
the collections of the British Library through a range of experimental 
crowdsourcing projects.

On the backend, Playbills uses an instance of 
<a href="http://pybossa.com/" target="_blank">PyBossa</a>, an open-source 
framework for the creation of crowdsourcing projects. On the frontend, a 
custom theme has been developed using 
<a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>, a JavaScript 
framework for building user interfaces. Project templates are written as 
snippets of JavaScript and HTML.

The theme, all project templates and further plugins are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LibCrowds).
