We're launching a project called *In the Spotlight* 
soon to make these digitised playbills more findable 
online, and to give people a chance to see past 
entertainments as represented in this collection. 
In this new crowdsourcing project, members of the public 
can help transcribe titles, names and locations to make 
the playbills easier to find.

We're starting with a very simple but fun task: 
[mark out the titles of plays by drawing around them](https://www.libcrowds.com/collection/playbills/contribute/). 
The screenshot shows how varied the text on playbills can be - 
it's easy enough for people 
to spot the title of upcoming plays on the page, 
but it's not the kind of task we can automate (yet). 
You'll notice the playbills used different typefaces, 
sizes and weights with apparent abandon, which makes 
it tricky for a computer to work out what's a title 
and what's not. That's why we need your help! 

We've chosen two volumes from the Theatre-Royal, Plymouth 
and one from the Theatre Royal, Margate to begin with. 
You can find out more about the project and the playbills, 
or you can just [dive in and play a role](https://playbills.libcrowds.com).

This project is an 'alpha', work-in-progress that we 
think is almost but not quite ready for its moment 
in the spotlight. In theatrical terms, we're still 
in rehearsal. Behind-the-scenes, we're preparing the 
transcription tasks for you, but in the meantime we're 
excited about giving people a chance to explore the 
playbills while marking up titles.

Please have a go and do let us know what you think: do the instructions 
make sense? Do the tasks work as you expected? Is there too much to mark 
and transcribe, or too little? Are you comfortable using the 
[project forum](https://community.libcrowds.com/in-the-spotlight) 
to discuss the playbills? Are there other types of tasks you'd like 
to suggest for the pages you've seen? 

You can help by posting feedback on the
