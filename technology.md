Playbills is part of the [LibCrowds](http://libcrowds.com/) platform, which aims to make the 
collections of the British Library easier to find by asking the public to help transcribe 
information about collection items.

On the backend, Playbills uses an instance of 
<a href="http://pybossa.com/" target="_blank">PyBossa</a>, an open-source 
framework for the creation of crowdsourcing projects. On the frontend, a 
custom theme has been developed using 
<a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>, a JavaScript 
framework for building user interfaces. Project templates are written as 
snippets of JavaScript and HTML.

The theme, all project templates and further plugins are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LibCrowds).

Transcribed text for each volume of Playbills will be converted 
into MARC-formatted metadata fields and ingested into the 
British Library's Explore catalogue.
