Each Playbills project comprises a collection of similar tasks. For example,
you might be asked to tag all actors associated with a particular play, or
transcribe a field that was previously tagged as a title. More information
about each task can be found in the project descriptions below.

Projects are also categorised according to location, for example, Margate,
Plymouth, or Covent Garden. You can select the location from the
"Categories" dropdown below. We will be adding more locations as the project
progresses, so if there is one that you would particularly like to see head over
the [LibCrowds forum](http://community.libcrowds.com) and let us know!

A task is marked as completed once three people have provided an answer. When
this happens a data analysis process is triggered and results are generated.
As well as integrating these results into our main database we can also make
them instantly available via our [Results](/site/playbills/results) page.

With each completed task you will be directly contributing towards a database
of historic theatrical performances. Choose a project from the list below
