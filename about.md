The British Library holds a significant collection of playbills dating from
the 1730s to the 1950s. These playbills list entertainments at theatres,
fairs, pleasure gardens and other such venues. Small 'handbills' were
circulated amongst theatre-goers enjoying the performance while larger
'great bills' were posted on walls and windows. The Library's collection
of approximately 234,000 playbills has been bound into over 1000 volumes,
some of which have been digitised.

These single-sheet items are usually empheral (fires always needed lighting!)
so the Library's collection exists thanks to zealous collectors who saved a
large number of sheets. These preserved playbills offer a wealth of
historical detail with thousands of personal names of actors, playwrights,
composers, and theatre managers. Less well-known and even forgotten
plays are preserved alongside popular performances and much-loved dramas.
Some of these plays may not have been independently recorded in printed form,
while some songs may not have been committed to any printed score -
transcribers may well discover previously lost plays or songs!

The rich details captured on each historical page - from lost personal names
to popular enterntainment to forgotten theatrical history - aren't yet
available to search online. You can help unlock this important collection -
help transcribe playbills today!

Your efforts will help uncover the level of detail important to researchers:
titles; names of actors, dramatis personae; dates of performance, and the
details of songs performed. Who knows what researchers will discover when
the collection is more easily searchable?

The data you help transcribe will be available from
[data.bl.uk](http://data.bl.uk/). Key information from individual playbills
will be uploaded to the Library's 'Explore' catalogue to permanently enhance
the way these Playbills can be found and reviewed. Immerse yourself in the
popular entertainment of the past while contributing to future research -
get started today!
