Your efforts will help uncover the level of detail important to researchers:
titles; names of actors, dramatis personae; dates of performance, and the
details of songs performed. Who knows what researchers will discover when
the collection is more easily searchable?

Key information from individual playbills will be uploaded to the Library's 
main catalogue to permanently enhance the way these playbills can be 
found and reviewed. Immerse yourself in the popular entertainment of the 
past while contributing to future research - get started today!
