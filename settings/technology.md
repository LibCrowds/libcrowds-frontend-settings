*In the Spotlight* is part of the [LibCrowds](https://libcrowds.com/) platform, 
which aims to make the collections of the British Library easier to 
find by asking the public to help transcribe and enhance information about 
collection items.

On the backend, *In the Spotlight* uses an instance of 
[PyBossa](http://pybossa.com/), an open-source framework for the creation 
of crowdsourcing projects. On the frontend, a custom theme has been 
developed using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), a JavaScript 
framework for building user interfaces. Images are loaded via [IIIF](http://iiif.io/) manifests 
generated from an internal repository for use by the Library's [new 'universal' 
image viewer](http://blogs.bl.uk/digital-scholarship/2016/12/new-viewer-digitised-collections-british-library.html).

The theme, all project templates and further plugins are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LibCrowds).

Transcribed text for each volume of playbills will be converted 
into MARC-formatted metadata fields and ingested into the 
British Library's [Explore](http://explore.bl.uk/) catalogue.
