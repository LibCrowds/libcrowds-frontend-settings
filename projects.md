Each project is a collection of similar tasks on a single volume. 
For example, you might be asked to tag all actors associated with a 
particular play, or transcribe a field that was previously tagged 
as a title. More information about each task can be found in the 
project descriptions below.

Projects are grouped by location, for example, Margate, Plymouth, or Covent Garden. 
You can select the location from the "Categories" dropdown below. We will be 
adding more locations as the project progresses, so if you'd like to request one, 
head over to the [LibCrowds forum](http://community.libcrowds.com) and let us know!

A task is marked as completed once three people have provided an answer. When
this happens a data analysis process checks that the results match. If they match, 
they're stored in our main database and made instantly available on our 
[Results](/site/playbills/results) page.

Each completed task directly contributes to our database of historic theatrical 
performances. Choose a project from the list below to get started!
