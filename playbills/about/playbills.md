Our newest crowdsourcing project, *In the Spotlight* is in 'alpha' - that
means it's work-in-progress and we suspect there are still lots of little
issues to sort out.

Please have a go and do let us know what you think: do the instructions
make sense? Do the tasks work as you expected? Is there too much to
transcribe, too little? Are you comfortable using the forum to discuss
the playbills? Are there tasks you'd like to suggest for the pages
you've seen?

You can help by posting feedback on the
[project forum](https://community.libcrowds.com/in-the-spotlight), emailing us
[digitalresearch@bl.uk](mailto:digitalresearch@bl.uk) or tweeting @@[LibCrowds](http://twitter.com/libcrowds).
