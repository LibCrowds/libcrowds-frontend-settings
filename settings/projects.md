Each project is a collection of similar tasks on a single volume. 
For example, you might be asked to tag all actors associated with a 
particular play, or transcribe a field that was previously tagged 
as a title. More information about each task can be found in the 
project descriptions below.

A task is marked as completed once a set number of people have provided an 
answer. When this happens a data analysis process checks that the results 
match. If they match, they're stored in our main database and made 
instantly available on our [Results](/site/playbills/results) page.

Each completed task directly contributes to our database of historic theatrical 
performances. Choose a project from the list below to get started!
